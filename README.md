# About
The To-Do List website is designed for people of all ages, including working professionals, students, and parents. It provides a simple and effective way to manage tasks, helping users stay organized and achieve their goals. Users appreciate the user-friendly interface and practical features like task creation, progress tracking, and task completion marking. The website is compatible with various devices and platforms, enabling users to access their tasks anytime and anywhere. People keep using the To-Do List because it helps them stay organized, stay focused, and get things done on time. It is a useful tool for managing priorities and making sure tasks are completed when they should be.

# UX

## User Demographic
The website is designed for:
* People who want to stay organized.
* People who want an easy to use To-do list.
* People who want to improve time management and reduce stress while handling tasks.

## User stories
* Working Professional: "I want a to-do list that helps me prioritize and manage tasks easily."
* Student: "I need a simple to-do list for tracking assignments and study schedule."
* Parent: "I want a user-friendly To-do list to organize household tasks and appointments."

## User goals
* Easily add tasks in the To-do list.
* Quickly mark tasks as completed to track progress.
* Easily delete tasks that are no longer relevant.
* Access the to-do list from various devices and platforms. 
* Have a clear and intuitive user interface that requires minimal learning effort.

## Design
The To-do list has a modern design with clean lines, simple colors, and easy-to-read fonts. The design is created to be user-friendly, so people can easily move around the app and use it without any problems. The focus is on making it simple and intuitive for users to manage their tasks without any problem.

## Wireframes
* I used Figma to design wireframes, which helped me to create a visual representation of the To-do list.
* The website was completed with only minor differences from the original plan. I made some adjustments, particularly in the header section, to ensure better integration with the overall design of the to-do list.

## Colours
I got inspiration from the specific colour palette below and I selected a few colours from this palette and combine them into the To-do list's visual elements.

## Typography
I used Jost font To make the To-do list visually appealing and easy to read. My goal was to create a pleasant and easy-to-read text style that goes well with the overall design.

## Logo
I created a simple logo for the To-do list to strengthen its visual identity. The logo is minimalistic and easy to understand, making it easier for users to recognize and associate with the to-do list.

# Technologies Used
* [HTML](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [CSS](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [JavaScript](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript)

# Testing

### List of main issues:

#### Footer doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom of the page
* The solution was to add flexbox container and set the CSS poperty for the footer to { margin-top: auto; }.

#### Auto-Zooming on input fields
* The solution was to add the following code to the head (meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"). 

#### 100vh on Mobile Devices
* I tried using the height: -webkit-fill-available property to make the webpage take up the full height of the screen on mobile devices and prevent scrolling to see the footer. However, this solution didn't work as I expected. I also tried changing the 100vh value to 100svh, and while it worked on some devices, it didn't work on all of them. So, unfortunately, the issue still remains.

## Validator Testing
The website underwent thorough testing to ensure proper functionality. The following steps were taken during testing:

1. Adding Tasks: The feature for adding tasks was tested by inputting different types of tasks. This ensured that tasks were successfully added to the list.
2. Marking Tasks as Done: The ability to mark tasks as done was examined. Tasks were selected and marked as done to verify the visual indication of completion and proper system updates.
3. Deleting Tasks: The feature for deleting tasks from the list was tested. Both completed and pending tasks were removed to confirm successful deletion.

These tests helped identify and resolve any issues related to adding, marking, and deleting tasks. As a result, the website provides a reliable and user-friendly experience for managing tasks.
Additionally, I tested the website on various devices and web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari, as well as on iPhone and Android devices. The website was found to display well and function properly on different screen sizes without any issues.

#### HTML
* The [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML code, and it identified missing close tags for the flex-container div and for the botton element. These missing close tags were added to ensure proper HTML structure.

#### CSS
* The CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and no errors were found.

#### JavaScript
* After running the JavaScript code on [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/), I received warnings regarding the use of 'esversion: 6'. To resolve this, I added the comment /*jshint esversion: 6 */ at the top of the JS file.

#### Accessibility (Devtool Lighthouse Report)
* I ran a Lighthouse test on the website, and it received a high score in most areas except for the "Accessibility" section. The reason for this is because auto-zooming on input fields was removed.

# Development and Deployment

The development environment used for this project was GitPod. Regular commits and pushes to GitHub were performed to manage version control and track the development stage. A Code Institute-provided template was used to set up the GitPod environment. The live version of the project is deployed at GitHub pages.

To deploy the project, follow the ["Creating your site"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) instructions provided in GitHub Docs, which involved these steps:
1.	Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2.	Find the repository that you want to deploy.
3.	Click on "Settings" at the top of the repository.
4.	Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and click "Check it out here!"
5.	In the "Source" section, select "main" as the branch and "root" as the folder, then click "Save".
6.	The website will be deployed, and the page will automatically refresh to display the link to the live project.
