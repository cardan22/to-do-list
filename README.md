## User goals

## Design
The To-do list has a modern design with clean lines, simple colors, and easy-to-read fonts. The design is created to be user-friendly, so people can easily move around the app and use it without any problems. The focus is on making it simple and intuitive for users to manage their tasks without any problem.

## Wireframes
* I used Figma to design wireframes, which helped me to create a visual representation of the To-do list.
* The website was completed with only minor differences from the original plan. I made some adjustments, particularly in the header section, to ensure better integration with the overall design of the to-do list.

## Colours
I got inspiration from the specific color palette below and I carefully selected a few colors from this palette and combine them into the to-do list's visual elements.

## Typography
I used Jost font To make the To-do list visually appealing and easy to read. My goal was to create a pleasant and easy-to-read text style that goes well with the overall design.

## Logo
I created a simple logo for the To-do list to strengthen its visual identity. The logo is minimalistic and easy to understand, making it easier for users to recognize and associate with the to-do list.
